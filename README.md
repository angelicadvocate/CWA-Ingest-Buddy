# 🚀 CWA-Ingest-Buddy

**CWA-Ingest-Buddy** is a helper script for Calibre-Web-Automated (CWA) that sorts, formats, and deduplicates files before they are ingested. It ensures your original book files remain untouched while preparing them for seamless ingestion into your Calibre Web library. 📚✨

### 🔧 What it does

- Moves files from your “books” folder to temporary folders to protect your originals. 📂➡️🗂️  
- Checks for duplicate file names and matching hash values. 🔍✅  
- Truncates and formats file names for better compatibility with CWA’s ingest workflow. ✂️📝  
- Safely moves prepared files into the “ingest” folder for CWA to process. 🚚📥  

This helps you maintain a clean and organized library while working within the limitations of the Calibre book processor.

### ❓ Why use it?

Many users want to keep their original book files intact, but CWA’s ingest feature deletes files from the ingest folder after processing. **CWA-Ingest-Buddy** solves this by creating a temporary staging area and ensuring no duplicates or messy filenames interfere with your ingestion process. 🛡️📚
